Knowing that he is former CIA, we can only assume that he has recieved mental security, protecting against invasions of the dream like we plan to excecute. We only have a short amounnt of time before he will become aware of our presence and his security will be activated. We must spend as little time on each dream level as possible. On the first level, we will look for clues or weaknesses that will help us find the code on a deeper dream level."';
